Portfolio site

Projects created at Galvanize using the PEAN technology stack. 

##1 In the personal portfolio project I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build a responsive, mobile first site. 
By intentionally avoiding built in frameworks (i.e. Bootstrap, React, etc) I challenged myself into untilizing the fundamentals of web building to create the responsiveness and dynamic portfolio site to accomidate any size device. 

Using angularJS allows for the flexibility to add more content without changing the overall feel of the sight, and still gives focus to creating the mobile first experience.   

##2 twitchMe utilizes the twitch.tv API and delivers streaming video content. 
The login process is secured with OAuth2 and salted with bcrypt.
ProgreSQL is used for the database and unique user info, game stream data, and twitch ID's are stored.
AngularJS was used to manipulate the MVC.

##3 myMEANTea is an ecommerce app.
An app that one can buy interesting Tea choices, with a shopping cart functionality. OAuth2 and bcrypt for secure purchasing. Currently no database has been added for return users.
 

##4 EpicEvents is an event agregate app. 
This app will search through a series of event API's and consolidate events based on the region selected. This current default region is the CA, bat area.

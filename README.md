Portfolio site

Projects created at Galvanize using the PEAN technology stack. 

#1 In the personal portfolio project I used CommonJS, HTML, and CSS to build a responsive, mobile 		first site. 
	By intentionally avoiding built in frameworks (i.e. Bootstrap, React, etc) I challenged myself into untilizing the fundamentals of web building to create the responsiveness and dynamic portfolio site to accomidate any size device. 

#2 twitchMe utilizes the twitch.tv API and delivers streaming video content. 
	The login process is secured with OAuth2 and salted with bcrypt.
	ProgreSQL is used for the database and unique user info, game stream data, and twitch ID's are stored.
	AngularJS was used to manipulate the MVC.
